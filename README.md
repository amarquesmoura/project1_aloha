## Description

A one page website including a navigation bar, banner, categories section, most-loved products and footer. This project has 3 different layouts according to screen sizes: desktop, tablet and mobile. It required using modern techniques, like flexbox.

## Main Takeaways

1 - I initially used a number of HTML markups to try and style the content, like "em", "strong" and "br. However, as I worked throught the project and learned more about CSS and its advantages, it became clear to me that I should avoid using HTML but for semantic markup. I removed the styling markups from my HTML and added styling in CSS by using classes.

2 - Developing Mobile First seems to be advantageous. It felt more natural to think what needed to be changed as the screen size expanded than the other way around. Besides, the constraints in mobile are greater, posing more challenges to the layout.

3 - It is important to strategize the layout both in HTML and CSS, by using the appropriate number of divs and classes. Sectioning the CSS file, which can become quite long, and identifying it accordingly makes it more readable and easier to navigate.

4 - JavaScript is a powerful way to add behavior to an website. Using jQuery, it is quite easy to add common functionalities seen in almost every website these days.

5 - It may be best to keep non-customized JavaScript code in a separate file than the scripts we create. This way, we reduce the risk of breaking its code.
